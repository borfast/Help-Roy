Help Roy is an open source animal adoption platform.

The idea started out of frustration when one of the authors couldn't save a dog from dying of illness, despite his best efforts.

The goal is to use SOLID development practices, TDD as much as possible, and some Domain Driven Design principles by separating the application code into different layers. This is obviously not a project for a client who has a domain expert to drive the domain model creation but it's still a good practice and with time we can get feedback from people who use the application and refactor whatever we feel is necessary.

More information coming soon...ish - hey, don't complain, this is a side project from a couple of guys who are extremely busy :)
